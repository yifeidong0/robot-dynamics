# Robot Dynamics Lecture Notes

This repository contains comprehensive lecture notes on Robot Dynamics, 2019 Fall, ETH Zurich, along with quizzes, MATLAB exercises, and past exam samples to help solidify your understanding of key topics in the field.

## Key Topics:

- **Rotation Representations**:
  - Comprehensive coverage of Euler angles, angle-axis, and quaternions.
  - Time derivatives of various rotation parameterizations for angular velocity computation.
    
- **Kinematics**:
  - Introduction to motion description using Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates.
  - Detailed explanation of linear and angular velocity, rotation matrices, and homogeneous transformations.
  - Forward and inverse kinematics of serial chain robots, and Jacobian matrices for velocity transformation.
  
- **Dynamics**:
  - Newton-Euler and Lagrange methods for deriving equations of motion.
  - Joint-space and task-space dynamic control.
  - Dynamics for both fixed-base and floating-base robotic systems (e.g., legged and flying robots).

- **Control Methods**:
  - Inverse kinematics and differential kinematics for position and orientation control.
  - Multi-task control, including trajectory control in task space.
  - Task-space control methods and operational space control.

## MATLAB Quizzes & Exercises:
- The repository includes MATLAB-based quizzes that test your understanding of key concepts.
- Exercises are provided to guide you through simulationsproblems.

## Exam Samples:
- Past exam papers from previous years are available to help you prepare and practice for assessments.
